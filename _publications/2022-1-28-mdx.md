Music source separation has been intensively studied in the last decade and tremendous progress with the advent of deep learning could be observed. Evaluation campaigns such as MIREX or SiSEC connected state-of-the-art models and corresponding papers, which can help researchers integrate the best practices into their models. In recent years, the widely used MUSDB18 dataset played an important role in measuring the performance of music source separation. While the dataset made a considerable contribution to the advancement of the field, it is also subject to several biases resulting from a focus on Western pop music and a limited number of mixing engineers being involved. To address these issues, we designed the Music Demixing Challenge on a crowd-based machine learning competition platform where the task is to separate stereo songs into four instrument stems (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Other). The main differences compared with the past challenges are 1) the competition is designed to more easily allow machine learning practitioners from other disciplines to participate, 2) evaluation is done on a hidden test set created by music professionals dedicated exclusively to the challenge to assure the transparency of the challenge, i.e., the test set is not accessible from anyone except the challenge organizers, and 3) the dataset provides a wider range of music genres and involved a greater number of mixing engineers. In this paper, we provide the details of the datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, evaluation results, and technical challenges for future competitions.
