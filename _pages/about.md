I’m a first-year PhD student in [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/) program at C4DM, Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Dr. [György Fazekas](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gyorgyf/).
My current PhD theme is about leveraging deep generative models and signal processing techniques for controllable and expressive voice synthesis.
The projects I made for achieving this goal are:

- [diffwave-sr](https://yoyololicon.github.io/diffwave-sr/): unsupervised speech super-resolution (bandwidth extension) using posterior sampling in diffusion models.
- [golf](https://yoyololicon.github.io/golf-demo/): a light-weight neural vocoder with glottal-flow models and differentiable LPC synthesis.

Before I started my PhD, I was doing software engineering and had worked for [HTC](https://www.htc.com/) and [Rayark Inc.](https://www.rayark.com/).
I also do independent research in my spare time.
My research interests include audio signal processing, music information retrieval, binaural audio, and machine learning.

I love making contributions on Github. Some of my most starred projects are:

- [torch_specinv](https://spectrogram-inversion.readthedocs.io/): a collections of spectrogram inversion algorithms.
- [torchnmf](https://pytorch-nmf.readthedocs.io/): a package that can help build complex NMF models.
- [constant-memory-waveglow](https://zenodo.org/record/4353123): training waveglow with constant memory cost.
- [variational-diffwave](https://github.com/yoyololicon/variational-diffwave): training DiffWave with unbiased ELBO.

I'm also the main contributor to making [torchaudio.functional.lfilter](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/functional.html#lfilter) differentiable.

My hobbies are music, manga, anime, and vtubers. My music taste is very broad and can be ranged from Heavy Metal, Djent, Post-Hardcore, to Happy Hardcore, Trance, Future Funk, Ani-Song, Lo-Fi, etc. I also produced some music (see my [portfolio](/music/) page) under the name **Y.C.Y**.


If you want to contact me for any reason, you can reach me via email or Twitter.
If you're interested in what I'm doing and want to support me, you can consider buying me a coffee [on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yoyololicon).
